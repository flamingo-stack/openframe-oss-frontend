/**
 * The Time dropdown's option list, pinned around the one condition the form
 * branches on: an EMPTY list.
 *
 * `ScheduleTimingFields` reads emptiness as "today, and its last slot has gone
 * by" and puts `NO_SLOTS_TODAY_MESSAGE` on the Date field off the back of it. So
 * the cases below are not really about counting slots — they are about the three
 * other days that must never produce an empty list, because each of them would
 * turn that message into a lie.
 *
 * Times are built from LOCAL components (`new Date(y, m, d, h, min)`), never
 * from a UTC string: the slot grid is local by construction (see
 * `slotBaseMinutes`), so a fixed instant would test a different hour of the day
 * in every timezone CI happens to run in.
