/**
 * The `[interval]` half of the form's two duration pairs (Repeat in, Stop Retry
 * after).
 *
 * **What the user types owns the display; the form value never writes back into
 * it while the field has focus.** That inversion is the whole component. Binding
 * a number input straight to validated state reads as a bug rather than a rule:
 * the previous version coerced an emptied box back to a floor on every
 * keystroke, so the digit reappeared as fast as it was deleted and "1" could not
 * be typed over. Any round trip through `Number()` has the same shape in
 * smaller ways — a leading zero vanishes mid-word, "10" briefly becomes "1"
 * while a character is being removed.
 *
 * So the raw string is local state, and the form is told the PARSED value as it
 * changes. Keeping the form current (rather than committing on blur alone)
 * matters for one case: submitting with Enter never fires a blur, and a form
 * reading a stale interval would save a number the user cannot see.
 *
 * The reverse direction — form → box — is deliberately narrow. It runs only
 * when the field is NOT focused, which is exactly the set of changes that come
 * from somewhere else: the record arriving (`useSeedForm`), or the unit
 * dropdown raising the interval to its floor. While the box has focus those
 * cannot happen, and nothing else may repaint what is being typed.
 *
 * Validation timing is the form's business, not this component's: errors are
 * held until the first Save (`showErrors`) and re-checked on blur
 * (`reValidateMode`), so nothing here is judged mid-word.
