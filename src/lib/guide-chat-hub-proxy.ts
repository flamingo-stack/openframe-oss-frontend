/**
 * guide-chat-hub-proxy — server-only streaming pass-through from the app's
 * same-origin `/api/guide-chat/*` routes to the multi-platform-hub chat
 * backend. This is what lets Guide mode run in the embedded chat without
 * the browser ever learning the hub origin or the service token.
 *
 * Contract (Phase 5, guide-mode restoration):
 *   - `HUB_CHAT_BASE_URL` is an ORIGIN env (no path) — e.g.
 *     `https://hub.openframe.ai` or `http://localhost:3000` in dev.
 *   - `CHAT_SERVICE_TOKEN` is a SERVER-HELD secret. The hub honors
 *     `x-chat-service-token` + `x-openframe-chat-source: openframe` on
 *     POST /api/docs/chat, POST /api/chat/agent/confirm-tool and
 *     GET /api/docs/commands, waiving auth with a 'service' tier (no debug
 *     powers). When the token env is unset we still proxy — the hub then
 *     treats the request as anonymous (degraded, but functional for public
 *     sources), which also keeps local dev usable without the secret.
 *   - The request body is forwarded RAW (`request.body` + `duplex: 'half'`)
 *     and the client abort propagates via `signal: request.signal`.
 *   - The upstream body is returned UNTOUCHED (`new Response(upstream.body)`).
 *     NEVER buffer or re-encode: the chat wire is a byte protocol using
 *     control bytes (\0, \x1E, \x1F) that any text round-trip would corrupt.
 *   - App cookies / Authorization are NOT forwarded to the hub (the service
 *     token IS the identity), and the token never reaches the browser (no
 *     NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix).
 *   - The VISITOR's IP is forwarded as `x-chat-ip`. See
 *     `visitorIpFrom()` for why this is load-bearing, not optional — and
 *     why the header precedence there is a security boundary.

/**
 * Extract the end user's IP from the incoming request.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS — do not "simplify" this away: without a forwarded
 * visitor identity the hub can only bucket by this app server's single
 * egress IP, so (a) the hub's guide-mode rate limit (5 req/min) is shared by
 * EVERY user of this deployment — the 6th guide request in a minute 429s for
 * everyone — and (b) every guide conversation persists under the same
 * pseudo-visitor, destroying per-user conversation attribution.
 *
 * The hub honors `x-chat-ip` only on requests that also carry a valid
 * `x-chat-service-token`; the service token IS the trust proof. We must NOT
 * forward the impersonation-grade `CHAT_PROXY_SECRET` here — this proxy
 * speaks for anonymous visitors and must not hold that power.
 *
 * HEADER PRECEDENCE IS A SECURITY BOUNDARY, AND TRUST IS EXPLICIT.
 * Because the hub trusts whatever we put in `x-chat-ip`, reading a header
 * that NOBODY on the request path overwrites hands the visitor their own
 * rate-limit bucket: rotating `curl -H '<that header>: <random>'` defeats the
 * guide limit entirely and attributes conversations to forged visitors. A
 * header is only overwritten-by-the-ingress on deployments that actually run
 * that ingress, so each vendor header is gated on an env that says so —
 * assuming it in a comment is exactly how the bypass got relocated instead of
 * closed:
 *   1. `x-vercel-forwarded-for` — read ONLY when `VERCEL` is set (Vercel sets
 *      it in its own runtime). Off-Vercel (nginx, self-hosted, k8s, localhost
 *      dev) nobody strips it, so it arrives verbatim from the client.
 *   2. `x-real-ip` — read ONLY when `TRUSTED_INGRESS_SETS_REAL_IP` is set.
 *      nginx populates it only where explicitly configured
 *      (`proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr`); everywhere else it is
 *      just another client-authored header.
 *   3. `x-forwarded-for` LAST hop — the always-available fallback: the entry
 *      APPENDED by the ingress closest to us. Ingresses that append rather
 *      than overwrite leave the FIRST hop entirely client-supplied, so the
 *      first hop must never be used. This mirrors the hub's own
 *      `getClientIp`, which takes the same end of the same header for the
 *      same reason. On a deployment with NO trusted ingress at all this is
 *      still client-controllable — that is the floor of what a bare
 *      pass-through can know, and it is why the vendor headers above must
 *      not silently widen it.
 * Values are validated for IP shape before forwarding so a hostile header
 * can't inject CR/LF or extra header material into the upstream request.
