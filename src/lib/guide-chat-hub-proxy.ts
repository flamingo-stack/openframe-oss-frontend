/**
 * guide-chat-hub-proxy — server-only streaming pass-through from the app's
 * same-origin `/api/guide-chat/*` routes to the multi-platform-hub chat
 * backend. This is what lets Guide mode run in the embedded chat without
 * the browser ever learning the hub origin or the service token.
 *
 * Contract (Phase 5, guide-mode restoration):
 *   - `HUB_CHAT_BASE_URL` is an ORIGIN env (no path) — e.g.
 *     `https://hub.openframe.ai` or `http://localhost:3000` in dev.
 *   - `CHAT_SERVICE_TOKEN` is a SERVER-HELD secret. The hub honors
 *     `x-chat-service-token` + `x-openframe-chat-source: openframe` on
 *     POST /api/docs/chat, POST /api/chat/agent/confirm-tool and
 *     GET /api/docs/commands, waiving auth with a 'service' tier (no debug
 *     powers). When the token env is unset we still proxy — the hub then
 *     treats the request as anonymous (degraded, but functional for public
 *     sources), which also keeps local dev usable without the secret.
 *   - The request body is forwarded RAW (`request.body` + `duplex: 'half'`)
 *     and the client abort propagates via `signal: request.signal`.
 *   - The upstream body is returned UNTOUCHED (`new Response(upstream.body)`).
 *     NEVER buffer or re-encode: the chat wire is a byte protocol using
 *     control bytes (\0, \x1E, \x1F) that any text round-trip would corrupt.
 *   - App cookies / Authorization are NOT forwarded to the hub (the service
 *     token IS the identity), and the token never reaches the browser (no
 *     NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix).
 *   - The VISITOR's IP is forwarded as `x-chat-ip` ONLY when the deployment
 *     declares an ingress that overwrites the header it was read from
 *     (`VERCEL` / `TRUSTED_INGRESS_SETS_REAL_IP`); otherwise the header is
 *     OMITTED entirely. See `visitorIpFrom()` — the presence of that header
 *     is a security boundary, not an optimization.

 * two rate-limit buckets depending on which side normalized.

 * negative means NO `x-chat-ip` is sent at all and every visitor silently
 * collapses back into this app's egress bucket, and a pass-through of
 * junk could smuggle CR/LF or extra header material into the forwarded value.
 * The lib handles the routinely-seen non-canonical forms (`[::1]:443`
 * brackets + port, `fe80::1%eth0` zone ids, `::ffff:203.0.113.4` IPv4-mapped)
 * and rejects everything that isn't recognisably an address.

/**
 * Extract the end user's IP from the incoming request, or `null` when this
 * deployment has no trustworthy way to know it.
 *
 * WHY A VALUE MATTERS: without a forwarded visitor identity the hub can only
 * bucket by this app server's egress IP, so (a) the hub's guide-mode rate
 * limit (5 req/min) is shared by EVERY user of this deployment — the 6th
 * guide request in a minute 429s for everyone — and (b) every guide
 * conversation persists under the same pseudo-visitor, destroying per-user
 * conversation attribution.
 *
 * WHY A WRONG VALUE MATTERS MORE: the hub honors `x-chat-ip` VERBATIM on any
 * request carrying a valid `x-chat-service-token` — the service token IS the
 * trust proof, so whatever we put in that header becomes the visitor's
 * rate-limit bucket key with no further checking. (We must NOT forward the
 * impersonation-grade `CHAT_PROXY_SECRET` here — this proxy speaks for
 * anonymous visitors and must not hold that power.) Sourcing that value from
 * a header NOBODY on the request path overwrites therefore hands the visitor
 * a bucket of their own choosing: rotating `curl -H '<that header>: <random>'`
 * defeats the guide limit entirely, uncapping LLM spend, and attributes
 * conversations to forged visitors.
 *
 * SO EVERY CANDIDATE IS GATED ON A DECLARED INGRESS. A header is only
 * overwritten-by-the-ingress on deployments that actually run that ingress,
 * so each is read only when an env var says so. Assuming it in a comment is
 * exactly how such a bypass gets relocated instead of closed:
 *   1. `x-vercel-forwarded-for` — read ONLY when `VERCEL` is set (Vercel sets
 *      it in its own runtime). Off-Vercel (nginx, self-hosted, k8s, localhost
 *      dev) nobody strips it, so it arrives verbatim from the client.
 *   2. `x-real-ip` — read ONLY when `TRUSTED_INGRESS_SETS_REAL_IP` is set.
 *      nginx populates it only where explicitly configured
 *      (`proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr`); everywhere else it is
 *      just another client-authored header.
 *   3. `x-forwarded-for` LAST hop — the entry APPENDED by the ingress closest
 *      to us (the FIRST hop is whatever the client claimed, so it is never
 *      used). Gated on the SAME `TRUSTED_INGRESS_SETS_REAL_IP` assertion as
 *      (2): both mean "an ingress I control sits in front of me". With no
 *      such ingress, XFF is wholly client-authored and its last hop is
 *      whatever the attacker typed, so an ungated fallback here would be the
 *      whole bypass the gates above exist to close.
 *
 * WHEN NOTHING IS TRUSTED WE RETURN `null` AND THE CALLER OMITS `x-chat-ip`
 * ENTIRELY — we do not forward a best-effort guess. The hub then falls back
 * to its own attribution (`resolveClientIp` → `getClientIp`), which under the
 * same untrusted conditions returns its `'unknown'` sentinel and buckets all
 * such traffic together. That over-limits rather than allowing a bypass, and
 * it is the SAME choice the hub already makes for its direct traffic: this
 * seam must not answer the question one way while the hub answers it the
 * other. Omission is also safe by construction — every hub read of
 * `x-chat-ip` is conditional on the header being present.
 *
 * SELF-HOSTED OPERATORS: if a reverse proxy (nginx, an ALB, Cloudflare, a
 * Docker ingress) does terminate in front of this app and overwrite
 * `x-real-ip` / append to `x-forwarded-for`, set
 * `TRUSTED_INGRESS_SETS_REAL_IP=1` to restore per-visitor bucketing and
 * conversation attribution. Without it guide traffic shares ONE bucket — the
 * once-per-process warning below is the only signal, so it says exactly this.
 *
 * Values are validated for IP shape before forwarding so a hostile header
 * can't inject CR/LF or extra header material into the upstream request.
